2 airspace monitoring modes accessible via the AIRSPACE button at the top

RDR has larger range and will set the radius of your airspace up to 25 km

Set your radius and your airport to begin monitoring

When planes enter or exit this airspace, a sound and notification are activated

VIS uses which planes are visible to notify you

When the number of players visible to you changes, the sound and notification are activated

While VIS is based on where you are, you can remotely monitor airspace using the RDR mode, which uses the input airport as the center of the airspace
